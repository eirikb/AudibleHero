<h3>How it works:</h3>
AudibleHero will;
<ol>
  <li>load your library.</li>
  <li>find all authors you have purchased books from.</li>
  <li>find all books published by these authors.</li>
  <li>group books by series.</li>
  <li>group books by authors.</li>
  <li>repeat 2.- 5. with incognito mode.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The list of books is stored on your computer, so if you go to another computer you have to run update again.
  <br>
  List of ignored books are stored on your Google account, so it will be shared between computers.
  <br>
  It is nevertheless wise to run update every time you open AudibleHero looking for a new book,
  or else AudibleHero will not know about them.

</p>

<h3>Incognito</h3>
<p>
  AudibleHero will run the update twice, once as your user and once as incognito.
  <br>
  Reason is that books you can see are regional based. If you do a search in incognito you will see all books.
  <br>
  It is possible to buy books cross regionality.
  <br>
  In order to determine if a book appeared only when in incognito the update is ran twice.
