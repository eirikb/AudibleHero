  <h3>How it works:</h3>
  AudibleHero will;
  <ol>
    <li>load your library.</li>
    <li>find all authors you have purchased books from.</li>
    <li>find all books published by these authors.</li>
    <li>group books by series.</li>
    <li>group books by authors.</li>
    <li>repeat 2.- 5. with incognito mode.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The list of books is stored on your computer, so if you go to another computer you have to run update again.
    <br>
    List of ignored books are stored on your Google account, so it will be shared between computers.
    <br>
    It is nevertheless wise to run update every time you open AudibleHero looking for a new book,
    or else AudibleHero will not know about them.

  </p>

  <h3>

    Incognito
  </h3>
  <p>
    AudibleHero will run the update twice, once as your user and once as incognito.
    <br>
    Reason is that books you can see are regional based. If you do a search in incognito you will see all books.
    <br>
    It is possible to buy books cross regionality.
    <br>
    In order to determine if a book appeared only when in incognito the update is run twice.

    Ignored books
  </h3>
  <p>
    AudibleHero let you ignore books. This feature let you "tag" books you don't want to show up on the
    front
    page.
    <br>
    The reason can be that you don't want to ever read the book, or any of the books by an author.
    <br>
    This feature was added because it was hard to see which books were really new books in series, and which were not.
    <br>
    While the list of books is stored on your computer, the list of ignored books are stored on your Google account.
    <br>
    When you run update on another computer the ignored books stays ignored.

    FAQ
  </h3>
  <p>

    <br>
    No.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>How often is the library updated?</b>
    <br>

  </p>

  <p>
    <b>AudibleHero doesn't find all books in my library.</b>
    <br>
    Some books are removed from Audible. It is possible to open them with a direct link, but they will no longer show up
    in search results.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>AudibleHero support authors with same name?</b>
    <br>
    AudibleHero use the author names to find books. Connection to series will work fine, but AudibleHero
    can't distinguish between two different authors with the same name.
    <br>
    As of today there is no distinct identifier between authors on Audible beside their name.
